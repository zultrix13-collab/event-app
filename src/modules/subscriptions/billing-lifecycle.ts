 * Subscription billing lifecycle — keep `bootstrap_pending_billing` distinct from billing-activated states.

 * - **Bootstrap / unpaid**: org is provisioned on a plan tier for limits, but billing has not completed
 *   (no verified payment path has moved the row to `active`).
 * - **Billing-activated**: `active` or `trialing` — post-payment (or explicit trial) states; not the same as bootstrap.
 *
 * Feature quotas may still use the **assigned** `plan_id` during bootstrap (starter limits); that is
 * “which tier is reserved,” not “billing has cleared.”
