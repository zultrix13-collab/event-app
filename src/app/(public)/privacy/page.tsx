      <p>
        Event App (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;the Service&quot;) is a social media analytics platform operated
        by Event App Mongolia. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you
        use our Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
      <p>
        When you sign up, we collect your <strong>email address</strong> for authentication purposes. We use a
        passwordless sign-in flow (magic links) powered by Supabase Auth.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Organization Data</h3>
      <p>
        You create an organization name and slug. This is stored in our database and associated with your account.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Facebook / Meta Data</h3>
      <p>
        When you connect your Facebook account, we request the following permissions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>pages_show_list</code> — to list your Facebook Pages</li>
        <li><code>pages_read_engagement</code> — to read engagement metrics</li>
        <li><code>pages_read_user_content</code> — to read page posts</li>
        <li><code>read_insights</code> — to read page analytics and insights</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We store encrypted access tokens to retrieve your Page insights. We collect page-level metrics (followers,
        reach, impressions, engagement) and post-level metrics (reactions, comments, shares). We do <strong>not</strong>{" "}
        collect personal data about your page followers or audience members.
      </p>

      <h3>1.4 Payment Information</h3>
      <p>
        Payments are processed through QPay. We store invoice records and payment transaction IDs but do <strong>not</strong>{" "}
        store bank account numbers, card details, or other financial credentials.

        Your data is stored on <strong>Supabase</strong> (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security (RLS) enforced, ensuring
        users can only access their own organization&apos;s data. Facebook access tokens are encrypted at rest using
